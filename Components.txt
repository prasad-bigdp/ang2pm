Component: Component is the reusable part of the UI(user Interface). Components can be kept one inside another called nested component.
To create a component command is:
    ng generate component component-name 

Nested Components:  component Inside another component is called Nested Components
eg: //app.component.html
<app-movie></app-movie>

Here app-movie is the child component and app.component.html is parent component

Communication between the components:
   components can send data from parent to child or child to parent or any other components too.
  Parent to child:
    Parent component can send data to child component in two ways
    i. @Input
    ii. content projection

    i.@Input() :
    Parent component can send data to child components as attributes/properties but those values are received by Child components using @Input() decorator

    //app.component.html
    <app-details name="prasad" age="28" ></app-details>
    <app-details name="shekhar" age="54" ></app-details>
    <app-details name="suresh" age="49" ></app-details>

     //details.component.ts
     @Input() name='';
     @Input() age=0;

      //details.component.html
      <div>
         <h2>{{name}}</h2>
         <p>{{age}}</p>
      </div>

    ii. content-projection: it allows parent component to project some content into child components template directly using ng-content element
    //app.component.html
    <app-details>
         <h2>Prasad</h2>
         <p>28</p>
    </app-details>
    <app-details>
         <h2>shekhar</h2>
         <p>54</p>
    </app-details>

    //details.component.html
       <ng-content></ng-content>
